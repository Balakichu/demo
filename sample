<p> My favorite sports person  is MS Dhoni .
 He is one of the most popular cricketer and one of the most successful
 cricket captain in the world. Born in Jharkhand
 he was passionate about sports and played shuttle badminton, football 
and cricket during his childhood. He was a big fan of wicket keeper batsman
 legendary Adam Gilcrist .Soon, he started impressing people around with 
his wicket keeping styles and aggressive batting and made it into 
junior and senior state team. His talent and consistency got him into
 a place in the national team under the leadership of Rahul,
 Dravid. M.S Dhoni soon became the permanent wicket keeper batsman 
for India. He won many matches for India and was an excellent finisher </p>

<h2> The Cool Master </h2>

<p> Dhoni was commonly known as "Captain Cool" 
for his calmness and patience on both on and off the field. 
The veteran wicket-keeper batsman, who is considered as one 
of the best captains of the Indian cricket team, has also proved
 on a number of occasions that why he was called the "Captain Cool". </p>

<h3> History of DHONI </h3>

<p> <img src="d7.jpg" width="900" height="550" </p>
<br>
<br>
<p> Dhoni made his international debut in 2004.
 His talent with the bat came to the fore in an innings 
of 148 runs against Pakistan in his fifth international match.
 Within a year he joined the India Test team, where he quickly
 established himself with a century (100 or more runs in a single innings)
 against Pakistan. Despite his inexperience, Dhoni took over the 
captaincy of the one-day side in 2007 and led India to the
 Twenty20 (T20) world title. Series wins over Australia and Sri Lanka, 
among others, moved India to the top of the International
 Cricket Council (ICC) Test rankings for the first time in December 2009.
 Dhoni was honoured for his play with the ICC One Day.
 International Player of the Year Award in 2008 and 2009. 
In the 2011 one-day World Cup, Dhoni’s dashing innings
 of 91 not out—in front of a home crowd in Mumbai—paved the way for 
India’s victory over Sri Lanka in the final. He also led India to an 
appearance in the semifinals of the 2015 Cricket World Cup. 
Dhoni stopped serving as India’s captain in 2017, having led his 
country in 331 international matches, the most for a captain in the
sport’s history. The explosion of T20 cricket on the Indian subcontinent
 paved the way for the formation of the Indian Premier League (IPL)
 in 2008. In the league’s inaugural season, Dhoni signed with the 
Chennai Super Kings for $1.5 million, which at the time was the largest 
contract in the IPL. He subsequently led the team to two consecutive titles
 (2010, 2011). The Super Kings franchise earned a two-season suspension
 from the IRL in 2016 for its role in a match-fixing scandal, and Dhoni 
then joined the Rising Pune Supergiant. In 2018 he returned to the Chennai 
Super Kings,and that year the team won the IPL championship. </p>
